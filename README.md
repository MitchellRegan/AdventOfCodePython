Most of my effort has been focused on year 2022's problems, since I've been having a bit of a competition with some of my friends (mainly [Matt Postel](https://github.com/BadWolf22)) to see who can finish it first. Before that competition started, I was jumping back and forth between the puzzles for years 2020 and 2021 during my free time. Regarding years 2015-2018, the only puzzles I've solved for those were mainly used as homework assignments in my Discrete Structures class. Once I finish the more recent years, I plan on going back and clearing all of those up.
